Dar El-Sabaek Website

The Dar EL-Sabaek website offers an interactive web experience, enabling the organization to display their products online effectively. Clients can effortlessly place orders and track them, ensuring a streamlined process that meets modern e-commerce expectations.

My Role: As a product manager, I was responsible for enhancing the user experience and implementing new features to better meet customer needs. Key features I developed include:
Delivery Delegates: This feature allows users to add delivery delegates to their accounts, enabling them to delegate someone else to receive their orders. This functionality is integrated with the Dar EL-Sabaek CMS, giving admins full control over customer accounts, including the management of delivery delegates.
Pickup Branches: Integrated with the Dar EL-Sabaek CMS, this feature enables admins to designate specific branches as pickup locations. The website dynamically reflects these selected branches, allowing users to choose their preferred pickup location during the order process.
